"""Single settings source for UltimateRAG.

Precedence, highest to lowest:
1. Environment variables (case insensitive), including a `.env` file if present.
2. Values loaded from `configs/{env}.yml`, when that file exists.
3. The field defaults declared on the Settings class below.

Rationale: environment variables are the standard way to configure a
twelve factor app and are what deployment tooling (Docker, Kubernetes,
CI) sets at runtime, so they must be able to override anything checked
into a yaml file. The yaml file exists for developer convenience, to
express a full profile (dev, staging, prod) without exporting a pile of
env vars by hand.

Implementation note: pydantic-settings, by default, treats constructor
(init) arguments as higher priority than environment variables. That is
the opposite of the precedence documented above, so `load_settings()`
does not simply pass yaml values in as constructor kwargs. Instead it
resolves the active env name (from the ENV environment variable, case
insensitive, else the class default), reads configs/{env}.yml if it
exists, and only fills in values for fields that were not already set
by a real environment variable (or `.env` file). This keeps env vars
strictly authoritative over yaml, while yaml still overrides the plain
field defaults.
