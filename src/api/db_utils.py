"""
Database utilities for UltimateRAG, conversation memory and document
records on Postgres via psycopg 3.

This module preserves the public interface of the RAGFlow SQLite
baseline (src/api/db_utils.py in the RAGFlow repo) while swapping the
storage engine to Postgres, the same instance used for pgvector.

Design notes:
- The connection pool is created lazily, on first use, not at import
  time. Importing this module must never require a live database,
  which matters for unit tests and for any process that imports the
  module without intending to touch the database yet.
- Tables are created by init_db(), not at import time. The SQLite
  baseline created tables as a side effect of import; that behavior
  moves into an explicit init_db() call that the application invokes
  during startup.
- All queries are parameterized with psycopg %s placeholders. No SQL
  string interpolation of caller supplied values, ever.
