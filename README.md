# rag-multimodal-2026

**Multimodal RAG: text and images are retrieved together from one vector space, and the images that grounded the answer are shown with it. The Multimodal (2026) rung of the RAG line.**

Part of the RAG line, a series of reference enterprise RAG implementations, one per retrieval strategy. This repository is the Multimodal (2026) rung. See [the full line](#the-rag-line) below.

## What makes it multimodal

Text only RAG is blind to everything in an image: the chart, the diagram, the screenshot, the scanned pricing card. This rung closes that gap with a caption-then-embed design:

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| See | At index time a local vision model reads each image and writes a detailed caption, including any title, labels, and numbers |
| Unify | Text chunks and image captions are embedded into one pgvector collection, so they share a single search |
| Retrieve | One similarity search returns the most relevant items, text or image, for a question |
| Ground | The answer is generated from the retrieved text and image captions together |
| Show | The images that contributed are returned with the answer and displayed in the UI |

Two models, both local: a vision model captions images, and a text model answers. Keyless throughout.

Stated honestly, because it shapes what the system can and cannot do: the answering model reads captions, never pixels. A caption written at index time is what makes images searchable with a plain text embedder, and it is also the ceiling: a detail the captioner did not write down does not exist at query time. That is the deliberate trade against heavier designs (a joint image text embedding such as CLIP, or sending images to a vision capable answer model), which buy more fidelity at the cost of a second embedding space or per-question vision calls.

## Tech stack

| Component | Choice | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| Vision captioner | moondream via Ollama | Small enough to run locally, good at charts and labels |
| API | FastAPI | Async, typed, OpenAPI for free |
| Vector store | pgvector on Postgres 16, one collection | One search over both modalities is the whole idea |
| Embeddings | Google gemini-embedding-001 or Ollama nomic-embed-text | Asymmetric task types: document map at index, query map at search |
| Generation | OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama | Routed by model name |
| Image serving | Base64 data URIs in the response | No separate file server; the UI renders inline |
| Memory | Postgres | Windowed history, reformulation before search |
| Ingestion | Celery + Redis | Captioning is slow, so it happens in the worker |
| UI | Streamlit | Chat surface that renders the retrieved images |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Lint, unit tests, pip-audit with no suppressions |

## Architecture

System context:

```mermaid
graph TD
    U[User in browser] --> ST[Streamlit UI, shows retrieved images]
    ST --> API[FastAPI service]
    API --> LLM[Answer model<br>OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama]
    W[Celery worker] --> VLM[Vision model, moondream<br>captions at index time]
    API --> EMB[Embedding provider]
```

Containers:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph net [Docker network, ports published on 127.0.0.1 only]
        ST[streamlit :8501] --> API[api :8000]
        API --> PG[(postgres :5432<br>one multimodal collection, memory)]
        API -. enqueue .-> R[(redis :6379)]
        W[worker] -. consume .-> R
        W --> PG
        W --> IMG[data/images<br>stored originals]
        API --> IMG
    end
```

## Data model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    APPLICATION_LOGS {
        bigint id PK
        text session_id
        text user_query
        text gpt_response
        text model
        timestamptz created_at
    }
    DOCUMENT_STORE {
        bigint id PK
        text filename
        timestamptz upload_timestamp
    }
    CONTENT_ITEM {
        uuid id PK
        vector embedding
        text page_content
        text modality "text or image"
        bigint file_id FK
        text image_path "images only"
        text caption "images only"
    }
    DOCUMENT_STORE ||--o{ CONTENT_ITEM : "file_id"
```

One table, two modalities, distinguished only by metadata. A text item's `page_content` is the chunk; an image item's `page_content` is its caption, and the metadata carries the path back to the stored original so the answer can show the real picture.

## How ingestion works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as FastAPI
    participant Q as Redis queue
    participant W as Celery worker
    participant V as Vision model
    participant P as Postgres
    U->>A: POST /v1/upload-doc (25 MB cap)
    A->>Q: enqueue process_document
    A-->>U: task_id, status processing
    alt image upload
        W->>V: caption the image (title, labels, numbers)
        V-->>W: detailed caption
        W->>W: copy original into data/images
        W->>P: embed the CAPTION, store with modality image
    else text upload
        W->>W: chunk (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
        W->>P: embed chunks, store with modality text
    end
```

Task lifecycle:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: enqueued
    PENDING --> STARTED: worker picks up
    STARTED --> COMPLETED: content stored
    STARTED --> FAILED: caption or read failed, record rolled back
    COMPLETED --> [*]
    FAILED --> [*]
```

## How a question is answered

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q[Question plus session history] --> H{History present?}
    H -- yes --> RF[Reformulate to a standalone question]
    H -- no --> SQ[Standalone question]
    RF --> SQ
    SQ --> E[Embed with the query task embedder]
    E --> S[One similarity search over the unified collection, top 5]
    S --> T[Text chunks] & I[Image captions]
    T --> G[Answer from chunks plus captions]
    I --> G
    I --> D[Load stored originals as data URIs]
    G --> OUT[Answer plus the images that contributed]
    D --> OUT
```

On a question the content does not cover, neither modality returns the fact and the model says it does not have the information rather than inventing one.

## Memory

Turns are stored per `session_id` in Postgres, windowed to the last 20 turns. With history present the question is rewritten to be standalone before the search, so "what does it show?" arrives at the vector store as "what does the Nimbus active users chart show?".

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as FastAPI
    participant P as Postgres
    participant L as LLM
    U->>A: "what does it show?" (session_id)
    A->>P: last 20 turns
    A->>L: rewrite with history
    L-->>A: "what does the Nimbus active users chart show?"
    A->>P: one mixed-modality search on the rewrite
    A->>L: answer from chunks plus captions
    L-->>A: answer
    A->>P: store the turn
    A-->>U: answer plus the chart image
```

## The mathematics

**Caption then embed.** An image $i$ becomes searchable text through the vision model $V$, and then a vector through the document embedder:

$$e_i = f_D\big(V(i)\big) \qquad e_c = f_D(c) \quad \text{for a text chunk } c$$

Both modalities land in the same space because both pass through the same $f_D$. That is what makes one search cover both, and it is also why the caption is the ceiling: retrieval can only match what $V$ wrote down.

**Asymmetric retrieval.** A query is embedded with the query task map $f_Q$, not $f_D$, and scored by cosine similarity against every item regardless of modality:

$$\text{top-}k = \underset{x \in \text{chunks} \cup \text{captions}}{\arg\,\text{top-}k}\; \frac{f_Q(q) \cdot e_x}{\lVert f_Q(q) \rVert\,\lVert e_x \rVert}$$

The two maps are trained so a question lands near its answer, not near its paraphrase. The store's own embedder runs at add time (documents), and search goes through the query embedder explicitly, which is what keeps the asymmetry honest with one shared collection.

**Mixed ranking.** Text and images compete in the same top $k = 5$: a question about a chart can fill its context with the chart's caption plus the surrounding prose, in whatever proportion similarity dictates. There is no per modality quota, which is a deliberate simplicity: the caption of a relevant image beats an irrelevant paragraph on similarity alone.

**Chunking, text only.** Text splits with size $c = 1000$ and overlap $o = 200$, giving $n \approx \lceil (L - o)/(c - o) \rceil$ chunks per document. Images never split: one image, one caption, one vector.

**Cost shape.** Vision runs once per image at index time, never per question. For a corpus with $m$ images and $n$ text chunks answering $Q$ questions:

$$\text{cost} = \underbrace{m \cdot c_{V} + (m + n) \cdot c_{\text{embed}}}_{\text{once, at ingest}} \;+\; \underbrace{Q \cdot \big(c_{\text{embed}} + c_{\text{LLM}}\big)}_{\text{per question, same as text only RAG}}$$

The multimodal capability is paid for at ingest, which is the right side of the ledger for read heavy workloads.

## How to use

### Local, fully offline with Ollama (no paid keys)

```bash
# 1. Data services
make db-up             # postgres with pgvector, plus redis

# 2. Ollama and the local models
ollama serve &
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
ollama pull moondream          # the vision model that captions images

# 3. Install and run
make install
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama make dev        # API on :8000
make frontend                             # UI on :8501, second terminal
```

Ask a question whose answer lives in an image, and watch the image appear under the answer.

### Try it with the bundled sample data

The repo ships text documents in [sample_data](sample_data), an HR handbook, a product FAQ, and a real SEC 10-K excerpt, plus sample images in [sample_data/images](sample_data/images), including a pricing card and a usage chart. With the stack up:

```bash
make load-samples
```

Loading captions each image with the vision model, so the first load does real vision work. Then ask about the images, for example the price on the Nimbus Pro plan card, and about the text documents.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| EMBEDDING_PROVIDER | google | google or ollama |
| VLM_MODEL | moondream | The local vision model that captions images |
| TOP_K | 5 | How many items one question retrieves across both modalities |
| IMAGE_DIR | data/images | Where indexed images are stored for display |
| CHUNK_SIZE / CHUNK_OVERLAP | 1000 / 200 | Text chunking parameters |
| MAX_UPLOAD_MB | 25 | Uploads rejected above this size |
| ALLOWED_ORIGINS | http://localhost:8501 | CORS allowlist |

## API reference

| Method and path | Purpose | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| GET /health | Liveness | none |
| GET /metrics | Prometheus metrics | none |
| POST /v1/chat | Multimodal answer with the images that contributed | 60/min |
| POST /v1/upload-doc | Upload a document or image, queue indexing | 10/min, 25 MB |
| GET /v1/task/{task_id} | Poll indexing status | none |
| GET /v1/list-docs | List indexed documents and images | none |
| POST /v1/delete-doc | Delete a document or image and its content | none |

Answers that used images inline them as base64 data URIs, so responses carrying several large images are big; the upload cap is the practical bound on how big.

## A note on access

The service has no authentication, and that is a decision rather than an omission. It is a reference implementation meant to run on one machine: docker compose binds every published port, Postgres and Redis included, to `127.0.0.1`, and the containers run as a non-root user. A shipped default credential would be the worse option, since it reads as protection while sitting in a public repository. What remains is real: per route rate limiting, a hard size cap on uploads, HTML stripping on every question, and a narrow CORS origin. Put an authenticating gateway in front before exposing any of it beyond loopback.

## Testing

```bash
make test        # unit tests, no database or model needed
```

Unit tests cover the modality routing, that a follow-up is rewritten before the vector search sees it, that search embeds queries with the query task embedder and goes through the by-vector API (the store's own embedder is the document one), the windowed history query, and the API contract without credentials. The integration test proves an end to end grounded answer against a live Ollama.
